# @media Query Example

## Introduction
Thanks for checking out my example of the power of @media queries!
<br>
When loading up the page on first glance, you should see 4 bars of different colours.
<br>
Start to shrink the window, and the boxes get smaller. But once you git 640px, that's where the magic happens.
<br>
Those 4 bars sitting side by side, turn into 2, and they stack on top of eachother, and they change colours!
